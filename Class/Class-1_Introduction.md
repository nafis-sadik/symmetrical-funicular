## 1. Data Science Overview
**Data Science** is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines domain expertise, programming skills, and knowledge of mathematics and statistics.

### The Lifecycle of a Data Science Project
A standard data science project goes through the following iterative phases (often described by the **CRISP-DM** methodology):

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Business Understanding] --> B[Data Acquisition & Understanding]
    B --> C[Data Preparation & Cleaning]
    C --> D[Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA]
    D --> E[Modeling & Evaluation]
    E --> F[Deployment & MLOps]
    F --> A
```

1. **Business Understanding**: Identifying the problem, defining goals, and understanding key metrics (e.g., reducing churn, predicting revenue).
2. **Data Acquisition & Extraction**: Gathering raw data from databases, APIs, web scraping, or files (CSV, JSON).
3. **Data Preparation & Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, parsing dates, correcting errors, and formatting. This typically consumes **70-80%** of a data scientist's time.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using statistics and visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices) to find patterns and anomalies.
5. **Modeling & Evaluation**: Selecting algorithms, training models, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating performance using appropriate metrics.
6. **Deployment & MLOps**: Integrating the model into production (e.g., as an API, web application) and setting up monitoring to track performance over time.

## 2. Artificial Intelligence (AI) vs. Machine Learning (ML) vs. Deep Learning (DL)
It is common to hear these terms used interchangeably, but they represent nested subsets of technology:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

```

| Criteria | Artificial Intelligence (AI) | Machine Learning (ML) | Deep Learning (DL) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Any technology that enables computers to mimic human intelligence (logic, rules, decision-making). | A subset of AI that uses statistical techniques to enable systems to "learn" and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. | A subset of ML based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with multiple layers (hence "deep") to learn representations of data. |
| **Approach** | Rule-based systems, expert systems, if-else logic, search algorithms, or learning algorithms. | Mathematical algorithms that map input features to output targets by optimizing a loss function. | Neural networks that automatically extract feature representations through hierarchical layers. |
| **Data Requirements** | Can work on zero data (e.g., rule-based chess engine using minimax search). | Works well on small to medium structured tabular datasets (thousands of rows). | Requires very large amounts of data (millions of samples) to avoid overfitting. |
| **Feature Engineering**| Manually programmed rules. | Crucial; human experts must select and transform relevant features. | Automatic; the network learns to extract features directly from raw data (e.g., raw pixels, raw text). |
| **Hardware** | Can run on standard CPUs. | Typically runs on standard CPUs; some models benefit from multi-core processing. | Highly dependent on specialized hardware like GPUs or TPUs for massive matrix operations. |

## 3. Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
At a high level, machine learning models are categorized based on the presence and nature of the target variable during training:

```
                           ┌─────────────────────────┐
                           │    Machine Learning     │
                           └────────────┬────────────┘
                                        │
                 ┌──────────────────────┴──────────────────────┐

                 │                                             │
         ┌───────┴───────┐                             ┌───────┴───────┐
         ▼               ▼                             ▼               ▼

```

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the model is trained on a **labeled dataset**. This means that for every input sample, the correct output (label/target) is provided.
- **Goal**: Learn a mapping function $f(x) = y$ to predict the output $y$ for new, unseen inputs $x$.
- **Examples**:
  - Predicting stock prices based on historical trends (Target: Numeric price).
  - Classifying emails as Spam or Not Spam (Target: Binary label).

### Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, the model is given **unlabeled data**. The algorithm must find hidden patterns, structures, or relationships within the data on its own.
- **Goal**: Group data points, find associations, or reduce the number of variables (dimensionality) without explicit labels.
- **Examples**:
  - Grouping customers into distinct segments based on buying behavior (Clustering).
  - Reducing 100 features of a dataset down to 2 principal components (Dimensionality Reduction).

## 7. Prerequisites: Linear Algebra & Statistics
Machine learning algorithms are mathematically driven. While frameworks like Scikit-Learn abstract away the math, understanding the underlying principles is essential for debugging and optimizing models.

### Key Linear Algebra Concepts
Linear Algebra is the language of data. Tabular datasets are matrices, and single rows are vectors.

1. **Vectors & Matrices**:
   - A **Vector** is an ordered list of numbers (e.g., $\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]^T$).
   - A **Matrix** is a 2D grid of numbers (e.g., $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$).
2. **Matrix Operations**:
   - **Addition/Subtraction**: Performed element-wise on matrices of identical dimensions.
   - **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiplying every element of a matrix by a single number.
   - **Matrix Multiplication (Dot Product)**: Fundamental for transforming data spaces and calculating neural network activations. For $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$, the product $C = AB$ is of size $m \times n$.
3. **Transpose**: Flipping a matrix over its diagonal (reflecting rows into columns). Represented as $A^T$.
4. **Identity & Inverse Matrix**:
   - The Identity matrix $I$ acts like the number 1 (i.e., $AI = A$).
   - The Inverse matrix $A^{-1}$ satisfies $A A^{-1} = I$. Only square, non-singular matrices have inverses.
5. **Determinants**: A scalar value that describes the scaling factor of the transformation mapping of a matrix.
6. **Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors**:
   - Given a matrix $A$, a non-zero vector $\mathbf{v}$ and scalar $\lambda$ are an eigenvector and eigenvalue if:
     $$A\mathbf{v} = \lambda\mathbf{v}$$
   - Essential for dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

### Key Statistical Concepts
Statistics helps us quantify uncertainty and make inferences from data.

1. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - **Measures of Central Tendency**: 
     - *Mean* ($\mu$): The arithmetic average.
     - *Median*: The middle value when sorted. Robust to outliers.
     - *Mode*: The most frequent value.
   - **Measures of Spread**:
     - *Variance* ($\sigma^2$): The average squared deviation from the mean.
     - *Standard Deviation* ($\sigma$): The square root of the variance, describing how spread out data points are in original units.
2. **Probability Distributions**:
   - **Normal (Gaussian) Distribution**: The bell curve defined by mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. Many ML algorithms assume features are normally distributed.
   - **Uniform, Binomial, and Poisson Distributions**.
3. **Hypothesis Testing & A/B Testing**:
   - **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)** vs. **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)**.
   - **p-value**: The probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is correct. A threshold of $\alpha = 0.05$ is commonly used to determine statistical significance.
4. **Correlation vs. Causation**:
   - **Correlation (Pearson's $r$)**: Measures the linear relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 to 1.
   - **Causation**: A change in one variable directly causes a change in another. Correlation does *not* imply causation!
